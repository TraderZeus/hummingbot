# Performance Tuning Guide for Hyperliquid Market Making Bot

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to monitor, evaluate, and optimize your market making bot's performance on Hyperliquid.

## Initial Monitoring Phase

During the first 24-48 hours of operation, focus on these key metrics:

### 1. Order Placement and Execution

- **Order Placement Success Rate**: Check if orders are being placed successfully without errors
- **Order Fill Rate**: Monitor how often your orders are being filled
- **Time to Fill**: Track how long it takes for orders to be filled

### 2. Market Conditions Analysis

- **Market Volatility**: Is the market highly volatile or relatively stable?
- **Spread Dynamics**: Are the natural market spreads wide or narrow?
- **Trading Volume**: Is there sufficient volume for your strategy?

## Parameter Optimization

Based on your initial observations, adjust these key parameters:

### 1. Spread Adjustment

| Market Condition | Recommended Action |
|------------------|-------------------|
| High volatility | Increase spreads (0.3%-0.5%) |
| Low volatility | Decrease spreads (0.1%-0.2%) |
| Wide natural spreads | Set spreads just inside the market |
| Narrow natural spreads | Use minimum profitable spreads |

### 2. Order Size Optimization

| Observation | Recommended Action |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Low fill rate | Decrease order size |
| High fill rate | Gradually increase order size |
| Frequent partial fills | Consider smaller orders |
| No fills | Check if your spreads are too wide |

### 3. Order Refresh Time

| Market Condition | Recommended Action |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Rapidly changing prices | Shorter refresh times (10-15s) |
| Stable prices | Longer refresh times (20-30s) |
| High trading fees | Longer refresh times to reduce costs |
| High competition | Shorter refresh times to stay competitive |

### 4. Leverage Adjustment

| Risk Profile | Recommended Leverage |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Conservative | 1x |
| Moderate | 2-3x |
| Aggressive | 3-5x |

**Important**: Always increase leverage gradually and monitor the impact on your portfolio.

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

After gaining experience with basic parameters, consider these advanced adjustments:

### 1. Time-Based Parameter Variation

Adjust your strategy based on time patterns:
- Different parameters for high vs. low volatility hours
- Weekend vs. weekday settings
- Adjustments around major market events

### 2. Inventory Management

If your inventory becomes skewed:
- Temporarily adjust spreads to favor rebalancing
- Consider setting a target inventory ratio
- Implement stop-loss mechanisms for extreme market movements

### 3. Performance Metrics to Track

Track these metrics to evaluate your strategy's effectiveness:

- **Profit and Loss (PnL)**: Both realized and unrealized
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Percentage return on your capital
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Inventory Turnover**: How frequently your inventory is traded

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Orders not being placed | Check API keys and network connectivity |
| Orders not being filled | Spreads may be too wide; reduce them |
| Frequent cancellations | Increase order refresh time |
| Increasing inventory skew | Adjust spreads to favor inventory rebalancing |
| Negative PnL | Widen spreads or reduce order size |

## Long-Term Strategy Refinement

As you gain experience, consider:

1. **A/B Testing**: Run different parameter sets and compare results
2. **Market Regime Detection**: Develop logic to detect market conditions and adjust automatically
3. **Risk Management Rules**: Implement circuit breakers for extreme market conditions
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare your strategy against simple buy-and-hold

Remember that market making profitability depends on finding the right balance between:
- Tight enough spreads to get filled
- Wide enough spreads to be profitable
- Appropriate order sizes for your capital
- Optimal refresh times for the market conditions

## Recommended Monitoring Schedule

- **Hourly**: Quick check of order placement and fills
- **Daily**: Review PnL, inventory balance, and fill rates
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive performance review and parameter adjustments
- **Monthly**: Strategy evaluation and major parameter optimization

By following this guide and continuously refining your approach, you can develop a profitable market making strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and the specific dynamics of the Hyperliquid BTC-USDT market.
